## Rickroll & Gandalf Sax Scripts

### Introduction

This repository contains two Python scripts, `rickroll.pyw` and `gandalf-sax.pyw`, designed to prank users by playing either the infamous "Rickroll" video or the "Gandalf Sax" video.

### Script Descriptions

1. **rickroll.pyw**:
   - This script copies itself to the user's Startup folder, ensuring it runs every time the user logs into their system.
   - It simulates pressing the 'Media Play/Pause' key 50 times, potentially interrupting any media playback.
   - Finally, it opens a web browser window and plays the Rickroll video hosted at [https://shattereddisk.github.io/rickroll/rickroll.mp4](https://shattereddisk.github.io/rickroll/rickroll.mp4).

2. **gandalf-sax.pyw**:
   - Similar to `rickroll.pyw`, this script copies itself to the user's Startup folder to execute on login.
   - It also simulates pressing the 'Media Play/Pause' key 50 times.
   - Lastly, it opens a web browser window and plays the Gandalf Sax video hosted at [https://eograhix.github.io/gandalf.mp4](https://eograhix.github.io/gandalf.mp4).
